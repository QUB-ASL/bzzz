### Soldering 
* The following outlines the order components should be soldered, as some components might be covered by others.
* Use heat shrink wrap where necessary.


#### Power disturbution board and ESCs
* Solder ESCs power supply to each corner of the power distribution board.
* Solder XT90 connector and UBEC power supply to the center of the power distribution board.
* Cut the header off the three thin wires (Close to header).
* The black and red thin wires are the BEC outputs and aren't being used excpet 1 black wire (This is needed for a common ground when calibrating the motors). Insulate (cover any copper) the rest and tape them to ESC.

  (if you have a V2 ESC, the yellow wire isn't used either and can be insulate and taped to the ESC)
  
* Crimp or solder Molex KK Terminal Contact to each of the white signal wires coming from each ESC.
* Crimp or solder a Molex KK Terminal Contact to the one black ground wire coming from an ESC (This is needed for a common ground when calibrating the motors).
* Cut of the connectors on the 3 voltage output wire from ESC.
* Temporally solder the 3 voltage output wires from each ESC to any of the wires on each motor (wires might need swapped to change motor spin direction).
* Crimp or solder Molex KK Terminal Contact to the wires on output 1 of the UBEC.
