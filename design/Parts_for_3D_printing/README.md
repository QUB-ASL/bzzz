# Parts for 3D printing
The above folders include editable Autodesk Fusion 360 files (.f3d) and STL files that can be 3D printed.

## Anemometer case
This case is to protect the Trisonica Mini ultrasonic wind anemometer that will be attached to the quadcopter

## The following parts are designed for the F450 quadcopter frame

## Controller case

## Motor stands
The 'Non-rotating' motor stand as seen in the photo below is for directly mounting a outrunner motor such as the 
'PROPDRIVE v2 3536' or 'Turnigy Air 3730' to the F450 quadcopter frame.

The 'Rotating' motor stand as seen in the photo below is for attaching a rod between two rotating motor stands and mounting the outrunner motors 
to the rod to add an extra degree of fredom to help control the quadcopter. A hole is included in the top so a screw can be put through the rod to 
stop it rotating if needed. The offset hole is for a rod where there holes were not drilled straight.

## Propeller guards
Depending on which motor stand is used a different propeller guard will be needed.

If the 'Non-rotating' motor stand is used the 'Symmetrical' propeller guard as seen in the photo below can be used.

If the 'Rotating' motor stand is used the 'Offset' propeller guard as seen below is used as the motor is no longer directly in centre of the frame.
